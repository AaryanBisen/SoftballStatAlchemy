Using the University of Maryland Softball statistics data, derive insights all the way from 1995 to 2023. 
These insights potentially help deliver new strategies to the UMD Athletics department to boost the team's win rate.
All data sourced from https://umterps.com/sports/softball/schedule

Insertion.sql manually inserts data into the insert query. I do not have admin perms for the data I am working with. Every value from the source files has been compiled and inserted accordingly to the tables created.
